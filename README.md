# Helper App
this is a front-end project implemented using react.js  
it combines both to-do app and note-taking app in single web app, which is persistent.  
the app stores the data locally using localstorage.  
this app is good way to learn react concepts like,  
"managing state  
react routers  
react hooks."  
1. this app was created using create-react-app and not vite.
2. so created app in any desired way and download the src and public folder and copy paste required files/folder in your newly created app. 

3. next install the node modules using "npm install". once done install the dependencies in package.json using "npm i".
#
Note: few dependecies might be deprecated, so try using latest versions and replace the older method or you can use --legacy-peers-deps to install the existing package.json dependencies.
